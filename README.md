## Description

**TrustChain** is a decentralized platform designed to seamlessly integrate charitable donations into e-commerce transactions through the power of blockchain technology. By utilizing smart contracts, TrustChain automates the donation process, ensuring that a portion of each purchase is directly allocated to a chosen charity, providing users with complete transparency and security.

Each transaction is immutably recorded on the blockchain, offering donors real-time verification and traceability of their contributions without the need for intermediaries. This approach not only enhances trust but also significantly reduces the risk of fraud, ensuring that donations reach their intended recipients with full accountability.

The platformâ€™s integration with MetaMask enables secure, peer-to-peer transactions, making it easy for users to engage in socially responsible shopping while supporting verified charities. By removing the traditional complexities associated with charitable giving, TrustChain offers a streamlined and user-friendly experience that encourages more frequent and widespread participation.
